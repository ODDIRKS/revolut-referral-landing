This script outlines a high‑impact, 13‑second TikTok ad designed to drive sign‑ups for your Revolut referral campaign. It’s optimised for vertical video, quick visuals, and strong calls to action.

## Scene Breakdown

**Scene 1 (0–1 sec)** – *Hook*  
Visual: A sleek smartphone or abstract card appears against a blue‑purple gradient background (matching the style of the provided image).  
Text overlay: **“Get €200 Revolut Bonus & Free IBAN”** in bold, white type.  
Audio: Upbeat, trending TikTok music.

**Scene 2 (1–3 sec)** – *Signup is Easy*  
Visual: Quick shot of someone tapping through the Revolut app sign‑up flow (you can simulate screens, avoid showing personal data).  
Text overlay: “Sign up in minutes with Revolut” in smaller, readable text.

**Scene 3 (3–5 sec)** – *Benefits at a Glance*  
Visual: Four icons or bullet points quickly appear in sequence.  
Text:  
• **€200 Revolut welcome reward**  
• **No monthly fees**  
• **Multi‑currency & crypto**  
• **Secure & regulated**  
Animate each point for visual interest.

**Scene 4 (5–8 sec)** – *Spend & Earn*  
Visual: Show a hand using the Revolut card to pay for something small (coffee, snack).  
Text overlay: “Spend, Earn & Enjoy.”

**Scene 5 (8–10 sec)** – *Reward Highlight*  
Visual: The card appears again with a sparkle or pop effect, and “€200 Bonus credited!” flashes on screen.  
Include a small “Limited‑time” ribbon or countdown indicator.

**Scene 6 (10–13 sec)** – *Call to Action*  
Visual: The gradient background fills the screen.  
Text overlay: **“Swipe up to join Revolut & claim your bonus”** and display your domain or link (e.g., `get200eurosbonus.com`).  
Ensure the CTA is centered and clear.

## Creative Tips

* Use engaging music that matches the upbeat tone.  
* Keep text large and high contrast (white on blue/purple) so it remains legible on mobile screens.  
* Include captions for viewers watching with sound off.  
* Add a small disclaimer at the bottom: “Terms apply. This offer is promoted by an independent partner and is not an official Revolut advertisement.”  
* End with a strong CTA and your landing page URL.
